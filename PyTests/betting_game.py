        # Updates from my previous code
"""
1. Moved the attempts increment code inside the try block to track the number of attempts correctly.

2. Added code to reset the attempts counter when the user decides to play again.

3. I added a while attempts < max_attempt loop to handle the scenario where the user 
   has two more attempts if they enter an invalid bet or a bet greater than 18.

4. Inside the except ValueError block, I added logic to check if the user has more 
   attempts left (if attempts < max_attempt) and provided the appropriate message. 
   If they have exhausted all attempts, it displays the message that they've used 
   all consolation attempts.
